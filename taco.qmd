In this page you will find a little history and information about the previous and current research project that I am working on in collaboration with a number of colleagues across the word. 

# A little history

Everything started back in 2015 while I was still working on my PhD. Back then I was not really involved in the developing of a remote tracking technology, but my colleagues in Rome had started to research in to ways to remotely monitor and track the critically endangered Gal√°pagos pink and iguanas, *Conolophus marthae* [@Gentile2012].
