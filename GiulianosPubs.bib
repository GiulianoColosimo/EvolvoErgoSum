@article{Garizio2024,
	abstract = {Abstract We present the first estimate of population dynamics parameters for critically endangered Gal{\'a}pagos pink land iguanas, Conolophus marthae, leveraging mark-recapture data collected between 2006 and 2021. Demographic parameters were estimated using the POPAN formulation of the Jolly--Seber model. This approach provided a solid and robust estimate, consolidating the results obtained from previous estimates based on the Lincoln--Petersen method evaluating only two sampling occasions. Our results suggest that the abundance of males was higher than that of females at each sampling occasion, probably due to differences in sex-specific behavior during the reproductive season. Our analyses also provide no evidence of a change in population size during the sampling period, estimated at 150--270 adult individuals, while suggesting positive entry rates. Finally, by comparing the biometric features of first-captured versus recaptured iguanas, we found that the former have more juvenile-like characteristics (i.e., they are, on average, smaller) than the latter. Although juvenile pink iguanas have rarely been recorded (only four sampled juvenile-like individuals in over 16 years of field work), our combined results provide the first clear indication that the only known C. marthae population actively recruits new members from younger age classes. Such recruitment may have prevented any measurable population decline in the last 16 years, but it was also not sufficient to clearly increase the population size. These results are of the utmost importance for the conservation of this species. They will guide future high-priority actions: (i) aiming at increasing population size by removing or mitigating threats and (ii) increasing the number of individuals by implementing a headstart program and/or founding a second viable population, as identified in the recently published IUCN Conservation and Management Plan.},

@article{Aplasca2016a,
	abstract = {The Endangered Allen Cays Rock Iguana ( Cyclura cychlura inornata ) is endemic to the Allen Cays, a tiny cluster of islands in the Bahamas. Naturally occurring populations exist on only two cays ({\textless}4 ha each). However, populations of unknown origin were recently discovered on four additional cays. To investigate patterns of genetic variation among these populations, we analyzed nuclear and mitochondrial markers for 268 individuals. Analysis of three mitochondrial gene regions (2,328 bp) and data for eight nuclear microsatellite loci indicated low genetic diversity overall. Estimates of effective population sizes based on multilocus genotypes were also extremely low. Despite low diversity, significant population structuring and variation in genetic diversity measures were detected among cays. Genetic data confirm the source population for an experimentally translocated population while raising concerns regarding other, unauthorized, translocations. Reduced heterozygosity is consistent with a documented historical population decline due to overharvest. This study provides the first range-wide genetic analysis of this subspecies. We suggest strategies to maximize genetic diversity during ongoing recovery including additional translocations to establish assurance populations and additional protective measures for the two remaining natural populations.},

@article{Colosimo2014,
	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Colosimo et al.Ecological data, the primary source of information on patterns and rates of migration, can be integrated with genetic data to more accurately describe the realized connectivity between geographically isolated demes. In this paper we implement this approach and discuss its implications for managing populations of the endangered Andros Island Rock Iguana, Cyclura cychlura cychlura. This iguana is endemic to Andros, a highly fragmented landmass of large islands and smaller cays. Field observations suggest that geographically isolated demes were panmictic due to high, inferred rates of gene flow. We expand on these observations using 16 polymorphic microsatellites to investigate the genetic structure and rates of gene flow from 188 Andros Iguanas collected across 23 island sites. Bayesian clustering of specimens assigned individuals to three distinct genotypic clusters. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicates that allele frequency differences are responsible for a significant portion of the genetic variance across the three defined clusters (Fst = 0.117, p{\%}0.01). These clusters are associated with larger islands and satellite cays isolated by broad water channels with strong currents. These findings imply that broad water channels present greater obstacles to gene flow than was inferred from field observation alone. Additionally, rates of gene flow were indirectly estimated using BAYESASS 3.0. The proportion of individuals originating from within each identified cluster varied from 94.5 to 98.7{\%}, providing further support for local isolation. Our assessment reveals a major disparity between inferred and realized gene flow. We discuss our results in a conservation perspective for species inhabiting highly fragmented landscapes.},

	abstract = {{Three subspecies of Northern Bahamian Rock Iguanas, Cyclura cychlura, are currently recognized: C. c. cychlura, restricted to Andros Island, and C. c. figginsi and C. c. inornata, native to the Exuma Island chain. Populations on Andros are genetically distinct from Exuma Island populations, yet genetic divergence among populations in the Exumas is inconsistent with the 2 currently recognized subspecies from those islands. The potential consequences of this discrepancy might include the recognition of a single subspecies throughout the Exumas rather than 2. That inference also ignores evidence that populations of C. cychlura are potentially adaptively divergent. We compared patterns of population relatedness in a three-tiered host-parasite system: C. cychlura iguanas, their ticks (genus Amblyomma, preferentially parasitizing these reptiles), and Rickettsia spp. endosymbionts (within tick ectoparasites). Our results indicate that while C. c. cychlura on Andros is consistently supported as a separate clade, patterns of relatedness among populations of C. c. figginsi and C. c. inornata within the Exuma Island chain are more complex. The distribution of the hosts, different tick species, and Rickettsia spp., supports the evolutionary independence of C. c. inornata. Further, these patterns are also consistent with two independent evolutionarily significant units within C. c. figginsi. Our findings suggest coevolutionary relationships between the reptile hosts, their ectoparasites, and rickettsial organisms, suggesting local adaptation. This work also speaks to the limitations of using neutral molecular markers from a single focal taxon as the sole currency for recognizing evolutionary novelty in populations of endangered species.}},

	abstract = {Critically endangered Gal{\'a}pagos pink land iguanas, Conolophus marthae, are considered a rare and elusive species. These iguanas are endemic to Wolf Volcano, on Isabela Island (Gal{\'a}pagos), where they persist as a single, very small population on the northwestern slope of the volcano. In an attempt to unveil important information about their ecology and behavior we monitored and analyzed the movement data of a male C. marthae collected over a period of 159 days, from 25 September 2019 until 3 March 2020. We used a custom designed GPS-Wireless Sensor Node (WSN) to remotely track and describe the migration pattern of this individual. Using GPS location data and trajectory reconstruction we documented an altitudinal shift of more than 1000 m. These results not only agree with observations recorded while collecting data in the field but were also used to reconstruct and describe the individual's migratory behavior, and to document the potential path that this individual, and presumably others of this species, follow while searching for food or mates. The altitudinal shift described whether shared across individuals of the species or part of intraspecific variation, may be related to different factors. Here, we discuss alternative interpretations of this behavior. The urgent need to gather data on the species' ecology and develop an appropriate conservation strategy underlines the importance of this research. Although it is not possible to draw conclusions for an entire species based on results from one individual, this work represents a significant advancement for the conservation of this species, as it validates the importance of using cutting-edge remote-tracking technology to collect data on a very elusive species, and it reveals ecological traits not previously documented for these critically endangered iguanas.},

	abstract = {Hispaniola is the second largest island in the Caribbean and harbors an extensive amount of biodiversity. The geologic history and resulting complex topography of the island has led to significant differentiation across various taxonomic groups. Hispaniola is the only Caribbean Island with two species of Rock Iguanas, genus Cyclura. Rhinoceros Rock Iguanas (C. cornuta) are wide-ranging across Hispaniola, occurring in isolated pockets, primarily in low elevation xeric areas. To better understand the population structure of this species, we used a combination of mtDNA and nuclear markers to elucidate the genetic variation of wild populations across 13 sampling regions in the Dominican Republic (DR), as well as neighboring Mona Island, home to a Cyclura population of uncertain taxonomic status. Further, we evaluate the origin of iguanas in captive facilities throughout the DR. Our data reveal a high degree of genetic diversity across wild populations within the DR and shed light on the taxonomic status of the Mona island population. Further, novel genetic diversity is found in captive facilities, most likely resulting from interbreeding between individuals from genetically distinct populations within the captive facilities. Our results suggest that the captive facilities may pose a threat to wild populations and increased regulation of these facilities is needed.},

	abstract = {The genus Cyclura includes nine extant species and six subspecies of West Indian Rock Iguanas and is one of the most imperiled genera of squamate reptiles globally. An understanding of species diversity, evolutionary relationships, diversification, and historical biogeography in this group is crucial for implementing sound long-term conservation strategies. We collected DNA samples from 1 to 10 individuals per taxon from all Cyclura taxa (n = 70 ingroup individuals), focusing where possible on incorporating individuals from different populations of each species. We also collected 1--2 individuals from each of seven outgroup species of iguanas (Iguana delicatissima; five Ctenosaura species) and Anolis sagrei (n = 12 total outgroup individuals). We used targeted genomic sequence capture to isolate and to sequence 1,872 loci comprising of 687,308 base pairs (bp) from each of the 82 individuals from across the nuclear genome. We extracted mitochondrial reads and assembled and annotated mitogenomes for all Cyclura taxa plus outgroup species. We present well-supported phylogenomic gene tree/species tree analyses for all extant species of Cyclura using ASTRAL-III, SVDQuartets, and StarBEAST2 methods, and discuss the taxonomic, biogeographic, and conservation implications of these data. We find a most recent common ancestor of the genus 9.91 million years ago. The earliest divergence within Cyclura separates C. pinguis from a clade comprising all other Cyclura. Within the latter group, a clade comprising C. carinata from the southern Lucayan Islands and C. ricordii from Hispaniola is the sister taxon to a clade comprising the other Cyclura. Among the other Cyclura, the species C. cornuta and C. stejnegeri (from Hispaniola and Isla Mona) form the sister taxon to a clade of species from Jamaica (C. collei), Cuba and Cayman Islands (C. nubila and C. lewisi), and the eastern (C. rileyi) and western (C. cychlura) Lucayan Islands. Cyclura cychlura and C. rileyi form a clade whose sister taxa are C. nubila and C. lewisi. Cyclura collei is the sister taxon to these four species combined.},

	abstract = {Monitoring marine resource exploitation is a key activity in fisheries science and biodiversity conservation. Since research surveys are time-consuming and costly, fishery-dependent data (i.e. derived directly from fishing vessels) are increasingly credited with a key role in expanding the reach of ocean monitoring. Fishing vessels may be seen as widely ranging data-collecting platforms, which could act as a fleet of sentinels for monitoring marine life, in particular exploited stocks. Here, we investigate the possibility of assessing catch composition of single hauls carried out by trawlers by applying DNA metabarcoding to the ``slush'' collected from fishing nets just after the end of hauling operations. We assess the performance of this approach in portraying $\beta$-diversity and examining the quantitative relationship between species abundances in the catch and DNA amount in the slush (reads counts generated by amplicon sequencing). We demonstrate that the assemblages identified using DNA in the slush mirror those returned by visual inspection of net content and detect a strong relationship between read counts and species abundances in the catch. We therefore argue that this approach could be upscaled to serve as a powerful source of information on the structure of demersal assemblages and the impact of fisheries. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

@article{Welch2017,
	abstract = {For species living in naturally fragmented habitats, the identification of conservation units is particularly challenging. Turks and Caicos Rock Iguanas, Cyclura carinata, are endemic to the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI). These Critically Endangered lizards inhabit less than 5{\%} of their historic range. A complete study of the geographic distribution of genetic variation is now particularly important for this species due to the onset of translocation programs. To fill this knowledge gap, we genotyped 280 individuals from 30 sampling locations across the species range were genotyped at 29 microsatellite loci, and variation within the mitochondrial ND4 gene was assessed by sequencing, or the use of PCR-RFLPs. A protein profiling analysis of femoral pore secretions was also conducted on a subset of samples. Microsatellites suggest that a recent, common population ancestry, or a simple reduction in gene flow, cannot account for the significant differences detected between a western and an eastern lineage within the TCI (Fct = 0.202, p ≪ 0.01). The same pattern was confirmed by mitochondrial DNA sequence, significantly distinguishing between the western and eastern haplotypes ($\Phi$ct = 0.96, p ≪ 0.01). Protein profiling provides further support, differentiating a western and eastern lineage. Implications of these results are that at least two evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) can be recognized across this taxon's geographic range. Multiple management units, within each ESU, can also be defined. Future management planning for C. carinata should consider these evolutionarily independent lineages.},
