When I travel, for pleasure of work, I do like to take pictures! I do not necessarily use my phone, although I would lie if I said that it is way easier to take pictures with a cell phone and the quality is, sometimes, pretty amazing. I shoot using a Canon EOS-77D and different optics. Below is a showcase of some of the pictures I like the most. Of course, pictures that have myself as subject were taken by colleagues and friends, and when I remember I will report the appropriate credit.

## People

Traveling is not just about seeing places, but also about meeting people...
