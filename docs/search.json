While helping me to keep my thoughts organized, this space is also an opportunity to share them with the rest of the world. Not that the world needs m thoughts, but I most definitely could benefit from the world’s feedback. At any rate, welcome, hope you will find something interesting, eventually.\n\n\nI’m a research associate working at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. One of the main aspects of my current research can be resumed with the acronym T. A. Co. — Tracking Animal and Conservation. The project aims at developing an integrated, versatile, miniaturised and cost-effective system for the remote monitoring of endangered animal species from even disconnected and difficult to access areas. This system will allow to acquire data relating to the welfare of individuals and populations threatened directly and indirectly by anthropic activities while measuring important ecological parameters. As a faculty of Tor Vergata University, I am also responsible for teaching classes and mentoring/tutoring students."

In fact, there already are quite a few packages allowing the processing of your Next Gen Data.\nThis little project came about with the collaboration of Giulia Maiello, a PhD candidate working on some pretty cool stuff here at the university with me.\nLets say that we have some eDNA samples collected from dirt samples or some aquatic environment. One possible workflow to follow to analyse your reads is highlighted below."

    "text": "Quality control\nThe first step is to check the quality of your reads. Lets not reinvent the wheel and use already existing packages to do the heavy lifting. The package Rqc works to our advantage. One of the advantages of this package is that it produces publication grade graphical output and gives interesting information on the quality of our reads (Souza, Sá Carvalho, & Lopes-Cendes, 2018).\nI wrote a small function to automatically use the package main functions and extract the most useful quality information from our data. For convenience, the function can also check whether the package is already installed on the machine in use and, if not, it will install it for us (after kindly asking, of course). To arrange the output of the analysis in a nice way we also need to use the package gridExtra (Auguie, 2017).\nThe function has three main arguments:\n\npath_to_ngs_data = path where to find data to be analyzed;\nextension = extension of data to be analyzed (generally .fastq or .fastq.gz);\npath_to_save = path where to save reports and images. The function creates a .png image so only the path need to be specified\n\n\nngs_quality_control <- function(path_to_ngs_data, ext_pattern, path_to_save){\n\n  pck_lst <- list.files(.libPaths())\n  if (\"Rqc\" %in% pck_lst) {\n    library(\"Rqc\")\n    print(\"Congratulations!

    "text": "Recently I had to deal with reviewing some figures I prepared for a manuscript that my colleagues and I submitted for publication.\nOne figure in particular needed a little bit of “re-styling”. It was the representation of the multivariate-spread of variance using a Principal Component Analysis. My dataset was fairly complex with two species of large reptiles sampled across three years.\nI struggled a while to figure out the appropriate code to make an image that could deliver the important and appropriate information. The main idea is that I wanted to graphically represent the distinction between the two different species sampled across multiple years. I also wanted to highlight differences between sexes. Below is the code I ended up using to achieve this result!\nFirst, the data. To make the example reproducible I used dput() from my R! session and copied the data. The code block below creates two objects: cent and vect. It is just numbers.

    "text": "2022-10-30\nIt finally arrived, the day of my departure for the fieldwork in Galápagos. I am not traveling alone, as two PhD students working with me, Lorenzo and Marco, will be traveling with me. Also, the PI of the project I am collaborating with, Gabriele Gentile, should be already there, as he traveled straight from the US after a he attended a conference.\nFor this trip the itinerary will be a little different. Instead of traveling straight from Europe to Ecuador, my colleague and I will reach Ecuador via Lima, Perù. As always, the departure times of each flight is totally unfriendly. The first leg of the journey starts at 07:00 from FCO (Rome), a stop in Madrid.\n\n\n2022-11-01\nAs my memory fails me constantly, I have decided to compile a list of names of people we have met already or that we will be encountering in this trip. When possible I will try to post a picture of them as well.\nEliecer Cruz (Jocotoco) Victor Carrion (Jocotoco) Ronal Gavilanes (Jocotoco) Marcelo Gavilanes (GNP) Christian Sevilla (GNP) Carlos Ramos (GNP, TIC) Juan Chavez (Jocotoco) Dany Rueda (GNP) Marvin (GNP) Evelyn Vera (GNP) Lucio Arana (GNP, mechanic shop) Gislayne Mendoza (CDF, Ainoa’s contact) Steve Bayes (GNP) Simon Villamar (GNP) Carlos Vera (Tienda) David Anaguano (Alcalde, ex TIC) Johanes Fernando Ramirez (GNP) Jorge Carrion (GC) Mirelle Mendoza (GNP, lady in Galo’s office) Yarol Alullima (GNP, TIC office) Raphael Chango (GNP) Wilson Munra Danny Callado Milton Javier Carlos Calucas\n\n\n2022-11-03\nVacation brake. They moved a national vacation one day up so that they could take advantage of the long weekend. Amazing Galápagos life.\n\n\n2022-11-22\nThe intricacies of bureaucracy. Trying to purchase things here using the university money is almost impossible. But we are managing. Gabriele has been more or less useless and too concentrated on himself to give any usefull advice so far.\n\n\n2022-11-27\nFinally about to board. Our shopping list was not how requested. Now that we have almost streamlined the process of how to buy the food I think it is better if we do it ourselves and not leave it to third party people. Things to remember for next time: onions and garlic in powder or dried, not fresh; olive oil; more resistant plastic boxes; tomato paste concentrated.\nThe quarantine has two refrigerated rooms and one non refrigerated room. Depending on who is there they will cut you more or less slack.\nChristian is useless. Never replied my message and he wasn’t able to find for us the things we asked.\n\n\n2022-12-12\nWe have found one of the WSN that was believed to have fallen from an Iguana. By visiting the last location points the WSN had transmitted we have been able to retrieve it from the ground. Carlos Caluca was the one who actually found it, but we were all looking for it and eventually it would have come out. Something, likely a giant turtle, walked all over it and basically destroyed it, but it should still be possible to retrieve the information it contains (which I do not expect to be much more than we already have!).\n\n\n2022-12-15\nThe generator gave up on us."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was born in 1985 and raised in Rome (IT). Always enthusiastic about the outdoors and all critters populating it. I got my primary and secondary education in Rome, but when I got to college I knew I wanted to experience research outside of Italy and Europe. During my master I spent 6 months at Aarhus University (Denmark) thanks to the ERASMUS project. I graduated with a Master in Ecology and Evolution from the University of Rome Tor Vergata. I then decided to get a PhD and started looking for a program that could interest me. I found one at Mississippi State University (Mississippi, USA), and Starkville became home for about 6 years.\nI got my PhD degree in December 2016. My project focused on understanding the population dynamics of iguanas inhabiting highly fragmented habitats in the Caribbean region. I focused on two species, the Turks and Caicos Rock Iguana, Cyclura carinata, and the Bahamas Rock Iguanas, Cyclura cychlura.\nAfter my PhD I stayed in contact with a scientist from the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Association (SDZWA) who had been a member of my committee. He was interested in writing a project on the pink iguanas of the Galapagos, and I was too. We teamed up to collaborate with a colleague from the University of Rome Tor Vergata. That project was funded thanks to a generous donation through the SDZWA and granted me the possibility to do a PostDoc for 5 years and to keep doing my research in the Caribbean as well as in the Galapagos."

    "title": "Road mortality model",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A very basic approach\nThe first approach used to quantify the impact of road mortality on iguanas on Big Ambergris Cay (BAC) is relatively simple. I used data collected doing driving transects. Starting in 2017 and until 2022 we have been doing four driving transects every year on BAC. We take advantage of the dirt roads crossing the entire island to cover more or less the entire area. While driving we count all the iguanas we find, and we classify them based on sex and age (juveniles individuals are not assigned a sex because it is almost impossible to distinguish between males and females without an accurate sampling).\nWhile driving around counting iguanas we also record all the dead iguanas that we find along the road. In doing so we can get a rough proportion of the dead-to-alive iguanas. We can then use that number to estimate a per yer percentage of iguanas that get killed by moving machinery only.\n\npath_db <- (\"~/Dropbox/iguanas/cyclura/carinata/databases/TCI_MasterDB.xlsx\")\ntransects <- read_xlsx(path_db, sheet = 13, col_names = T, na = \"\\\\N\",\n                       col_types = c(\"numeric\", \"text\", \"numeric\", \"numeric\",\n                                     \"text\", \"numeric\", \"text\", \"text\",\n                                     \"text\", \"numeric\", \"numeric\", \"date\",\n                                     \"guess\", \"text\"))\ntrs_bac <- transects %>% \n  filter(island == \"Big Ambergris Cay\")\ntable(year(trs_bac$date), trs_bac$trct_rep)\n\n      \n         1   2   3   4\n  2017 187 306 268 269\n  2018 211 300 217 227\n  2019 245 227 247 237\n  2020 188 250 189 207\n  2022 287 229 281 260\n\n\nThese are the number of iguanas spotted during each of the transects in each year. Note that in 2021 we were not able to do the transect due to COVID-19 pandemic. Also note that all transects are done in the same time of the year, February/March. We can compute some basic stats based on the above numbers. For example the mean and sd of all\n\ntrs_bac2 <- trs_bac %>% \n  group_by(year(date), trct_rep) %>% \n  dplyr::summarise(n = n())\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year(date)'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\nnames(trs_bac2) <- c(\"year\", \"trct_rep\", \"n\")\n\ntrs_bac3 <- trs_bac2 %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  dplyr::summarise(mean_n = mean(n),\n                   sd_n = sd(n),\n                   max_n = max(n))\ntrs_bac3\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n   year mean_n  sd_n max_n\n  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <int>\n1  2017   258. 50.2    306\n2  2018   239. 41.4    300\n3  2019   239   9.09   247\n4  2020   208. 29.0    250\n5  2022   264. 26.2    287\n\n\nFinally, I used the number of road kills counted in the same years the transects were performed and I can estimate an average per year percentage mortality rate.\n\nmean((c(8, 15, 20, 6, 24)/(trs_bac3$max_n + c(8, 15, 20, 6, 24)))*100)\n\n[1] 4.972221\n\n\nIf we assume the population on BAC is about 10000 iguana individuals this means there are almost 500 iguanas killed every year on the road. This is probably a gross overestimation of the road mortality, but it gives us a good starting point to refine our model and add more variables and get a more accurate estimate.\n\n\nA more complex approach"

The system allows not only to collect real-time data on the position of the tagged individual, but also to monitor physiological and environmental parameters useful for assessing the behavior and welfare of the individual. The multidisciplinary nature of this project has promoted a high level of collaboration with national and international partners.\nMy research interests encompass biogeography, molecular phylogeny, genetic structure of populations, movement and behavioral ecology, and bioinformatics. Given that my research has consistently involved a substantial field component for the collection of biological samples, I have developed extensive experience in organizing and conducting data collection missions in the field.\n\n\n\nIf you want to write me, or you need quick access to my CV or some of my linked accounts you can click on the icons located right below my picture, in the upper left side corner.

    "title": "Automated download of weather data from Italian monitoring stations.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Last year, during the Conservation Biology course I was teaching, I had planned to do a practical exercise and have the students download and analyse some historical weather data for Italy.\nNot too long ago it was possible to download historical weather data relatively easily from a number of different websites. Unfortunately this option is no longer available and there really is only a handful of sites from which it is possible to download historical data for free.\nOne of them is here, hosted on the Iowa State University website. The user interface is pretty intuitive and it is possible to select from a pretty amazing variety of network of data from all over the world.\nAnother very cool thing about this portal is that it offers a few line of codes, in R and Python, to automate the download of the data of interest. I have tried the R script, but I couldn’t make it work “as is”. I did a few changes to the original code to make it do what it was supposed to do, and since I did it for my students I thought it would be nice to make a blog post. I here provide a full rundown on how to use the script. The description includes the installation of a few necessary packages to download historical weather data. The worked out example shows how to download data for the Italian peninsula, but with a few tweaks and changes it is possible to adapt it to download all data of interest.\nBuckle up and lets begin. First of all, let me give you an overview of the OS and R version I am working with. After downloading the appropriate packages the code should work for all platforms. Regardless, I will start by sharing my session information.\n\nsessionInfo()\n\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.5.2\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/Rome\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.2 compiler_4.3.1    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.1        \n [5] tools_4.3.1       htmltools_0.5.5   rstudioapi_0.14   yaml_2.3.7       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.22    knitr_1.42        jsonlite_1.8.5    xfun_0.39        \n[13] digest_0.6.31     rlang_1.1.1       evaluate_0.21    \n\n\nSo, I pretty much just opened R and didn’t attach any package but the ones that automatically are loaded when you open a new working session.\nTo accomplish this task we do need to install and load a few packages that will allow R to interact with web pages and read/download information from the specified website. The code below will install on your machine the necessary packages. Of course, you will not need this step if the packages are already installed.\n\n# Installing the appropriate packages\ninstall.packages(c(\"jsonlite\", \"RCurl\", \"lubridate\", \"dplyr\", \"ggplot2\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe output of the above line of code is not shown, as the packages are already installed on my machine.\n\n\nOnce installed we can load the packages in the current working session.\n\n# Load packages in the working session\nx &lt;- c(\"jsonlite\", \"RCurl\", \"lubridate\", \"dplyr\", \"ggplot2\")\nlapply(x, require, character.only = T)\n\nLoading required package: jsonlite\n\n\nLoading required package: RCurl\n\n\nLoading required package: lubridate\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'lubridate'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    date, intersect, setdiff, union\n\n\nLoading required package: dplyr\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n\n\n[[1]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[2]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[3]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[4]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[5]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nPerfect. If you have a list with all TRUE values it means that everything worked fine, and we can move on to the next steps. We can now specify 2 important variables that will be used in the automated script. We need a start and an end date that will be used to identify the time window of interest for which we would like to download the data of interest.\n\n# specify the date boundaries of our dataset\ndate1 &lt;- ISOdate(1990,1,1)   # start date in year, month, day format\ndate2 &lt;- ISOdate(2020,12,31) # end date in year, month, day format\n\nThe second step is to set 2 other variables containing the data network infrastructure from which we want to download the data and the specific country/state of interest.\n\nuser.network &lt;- c(\"ASOS\") # data network\nuser.state &lt;- c(\"IT\")     # state\n\nIf we were to do this procedure manually directly on the ISU web page at this point we will be selecting the appropriate country/state and network from the dedicated drop down menu, as shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Highlighted in blue is the drop down menu that we could use on the web page to select the specific country/state and data network of interest.\n\n\nOne of the advantages of the automated procedure through R, though, is that once we have perfected the procedure for a specified the country/state and data network we can repeat the same procedure over and over with different states and or location of interest. Anyway, lets keep going with our procedure. From Figure 1 it is possible to see that, after selecting the Italian ASOS network, a list of of available weather stations appears in the left box right underneath the Select Widget for IT_ASOS Network claim. What the web page is telling us is that of all the weather stations available for the ASOS network in Italy we can pick and choose the ones we want to download the data from. Unless we really know what we are doing and unless we know exactly the precise station we want data from we need to do a little more work to figure out how many stations are available, where they are and what is their specific ID.\nSo, using a little information taken directly from the URL bar of our browsers we can tell R to open a connection to the desired web page to download the information we need. We do this with the following few lines of code.\n\n# Create and open a connection\nnetwork &lt;- paste(user.state, user.network, sep = \"__\")\nuri &lt;- paste(\"https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/geojson/network/\", network, \".geojson\", sep=\"\")\ndata &lt;- url(uri)\njdict &lt;- fromJSON(data)\nclass(jdict)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\nnames(jdict)\n\n[1] \"type\"            \"features\"        \"generation_time\" \"count\"          \n\n\nWe have created and opened a connection to a .geojson file from the specified webpage containing all the necessary information. All the data are then stored in an object that we have called jdict. This is a list with four elements named as indicated above. Based on the names of the list elements we can infer that the second element of the list has the features of interest to us. We can look the first 5 rows of the data frame contained in the second element of the jdict list.\n\nhead(jdict[[2]])\n\n     type   id properties.elevation properties.sname properties.time_domain\n1 Feature LIMG              49.0000          Albenga             (1973-Now)\n2 Feature LIEA              23.0000          Alghero             (1957-Now)\n3 Feature LIBA              60.0000         Amendola             (1944-Now)\n4 Feature LIPY              10.0000           Ancona             (1945-Now)\n5 Feature LIMW             545.0000            Aosta             (1984-Now)\n6 Feature LIQB             246.8307           Arezzo            (1978-2016)\n  properties.archive_begin properties.archive_end properties.state\n1               1973-01-01                   &lt;NA&gt;             &lt;NA&gt;\n2               1957-06-30                   &lt;NA&gt;             &lt;NA&gt;\n3               1944-01-31                   &lt;NA&gt;             &lt;NA&gt;\n4               1945-04-14                   &lt;NA&gt;             &lt;NA&gt;\n5               1984-06-30                   &lt;NA&gt;             &lt;NA&gt;\n6               1978-09-14             2016-03-06                 \n  properties.country properties.climate_site properties.wfo properties.tzname\n1                 IT                      NA             NA       Europe/Rome\n2                 IT                      NA             NA       Europe/Rome\n3                 IT                      NA             NA       Europe/Rome\n4                 IT                      NA             NA       Europe/Rome\n5                 IT                      NA             NA       Europe/Rome\n6                 IT                      NA             NA       Europe/Rome\n  properties.ncdc81 properties.ncei91 properties.ugc_county properties.ugc_zone\n1                NA                NA                    NA                  NA\n2                NA                NA                    NA                  NA\n3                NA                NA                    NA                  NA\n4                NA                NA                    NA                  NA\n5                NA                NA                    NA                  NA\n6                NA                NA                    NA                  NA\n  properties.county properties.sid properties.network geometry.type\n1                NA           LIMG           IT__ASOS         Point\n2                NA           LIEA           IT__ASOS         Point\n3                NA           LIBA           IT__ASOS         Point\n4                NA           LIPY           IT__ASOS         Point\n5                NA           LIMW           IT__ASOS         Point\n6                NA           LIQB           IT__ASOS         Point\n  geometry.coordinates\n1      8.1256, 44.0458\n2      8.2886, 40.6311\n3     15.7139, 41.5381\n4     13.3603, 43.6167\n5      7.3687, 45.7385\n6     11.8456, 43.4597\n\n\nAs anticipated, this element contains all the information we need. There are 108 stations in Italy from where we can download data. Of the many variables for each location what is more important to us is the id of each station, its properties.sname, the properties.time_domain and the geometry.coordinates of each station. In fact, as a simple exercise we can make a plot to see how and where are the stations distributed.\n\nstationsPlot &lt;- matrix(unlist(jdict$features$geometry$coordinates), nrow = 2)\nplot(stationsPlot[1,], stationsPlot[2,], asp = 1)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Location of all weather stations around available from the ISU repository.\n\n\nIt is interesting to see that there are so many stations that they can pretty much reproduce the outline and profile of the iconic Italian boot (Figure 2)! This is all nice and good. Now lets get to the fun part. Let us say that we want to download data from ALL the stations available. Using the web interface from Figure 1 we would be selecting all the stations from the left box, move them to the right box. Then go to the right side of the page (Figure 3) and specify a number of things like the kind of desired output (CSV rather than TXT rather than DAT), the appropriate dates for the time window of interest and what kind of weather variable we would like data for (temperature, rain, wind, etc. etc. etc.).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Highlighted in red is the section of the page where to specifiy the kind of information needed, the time window of interest and the specific output format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease remember these two points. First, not all stations will have data available for the time window selected. Some stations were only recently activated and it is therefore unlikely that we will be able to get data since, for example, 1970. The other issue is related to the type of variable available for download. The only variable available for bulk download in many data network not US based is only temperature!\n\n\nNow we create a string that contains an URL with the start date and the end date. This is the URL that would appear every time we would download manually the information from the website. At this time we still do not have any information re which station we request the data from.\n\nservice &lt;- \"https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/request/asos.py?\"\nservice &lt;- paste(service, \"data=all&tz=Etc/UTC&format=comma&latlon=yes&\", sep=\"\")\nservice &lt;- paste(service, \"year1=\", year(date1), \"&month1=\", month(date1), \"&day1=\", mday(date1), \"&\", sep=\"\")\nservice &lt;- paste(service, \"year2=\", year(date2), \"&month2=\", month(date2), \"&day2=\", mday(date2), \"&\", sep=\"\")\nservice\n\n[1] \"https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/request/asos.py?data=all&tz=Etc/UTC&format=comma&latlon=yes&year1=1990&month1=1&day1=1&year2=2020&month2=12&day2=31&\"\n\n\nNow we set the working directory to a dedicated folder. Note that the data could be large several GB, and it may be convenient to store them on an external hard drive.\n\nsetwd(\"path/to/your/folder/of/choice\")\n\nOK. We are almost there. The final part of this tutorial consists in creating a loop that will take the part of the URL that is constant every time and add, recursively until the very last one, the ID of the weather station we want the data from. Once again, when you run the script make sure that you have enough space on your dedicated folder and that you have enough time and a good internet connection to download all the data. Needless to say that if you first want to try the script on only a few stations you can subset the stations ID and select only 1 or 2 for a quick test.\n\nit_stations_id &lt;- jdict$features$id\nit_stations_nm &lt;- jdict$features$properties$sname\n\nfor (i in 1:length(it_stations_id[1:2])){\n  uri &lt;- paste(service, \"station=\", it_stations_id[i], sep = \"\")\n  print(paste(\"Network:\", network, \n              \"Downloading:\", it_stations_nm[i], it_stations_id[i], sep=\" \"))\n  data &lt;- url(uri)\n  datestring1 &lt;- format(date1, \"%Y%m%d\")\n  datestring2 &lt;- format(date2, \"%Y%m%d\")\n  outfn &lt;- paste(network, \"_\", it_stations_id[i], \"_\", datestring1, \"_to_\", datestring2, sep=\"\")\n  download.file(uri, paste(outfn, \".csv\"), \"auto\")\n}\n\nAs the loop proceeds you should see information on what is being downloaded printed on your R prompt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDepending on your internet connection it may happen that your download procedure will stop because of time out issues! Unfortunately I am yet to find a proper solution to this problem. Of course, you should make sure that you work with a stable and fast internet connection. If the issue manifests itself, and it usually does with large files, what you can do is to edit the vector of stations to download to momentary exclude the station that gives you problem, finish the download of the other stations and then come back to the one that gives problem to download it by itself.\n\n\nOnce the procedure is completed you will have all your data ready to be analysed in your folder. In the next post we will try to look at some of the downloaded data and make a few basic analysis.\nDid you like this post? Drop a comment down here or let me know by e-mail what you think of it or if you have questions or curiosities. Till next time.\nCheers"

It was the representation of the multivariate-spread of variance using a Principal Component Analysis. My dataset was fairly complex with two species of large reptiles sampled across three years.\nI struggled a while to figure out the appropriate code to make an image that could deliver the important and appropriate information. The main idea is that I wanted to graphically represent the distinction between the two different species sampled across multiple years. I also wanted to highlight differences between sexes. Below is the code I ended up using to achieve this result!\nFirst, the data. To make the example reproducible I used dput() from my R! session and copied the data.

    "text": "A very basic approach\nThe first approach used to quantify the impact of road mortality on iguanas on Big Ambergris Cay (BAC) is relatively simple. I used data collected doing driving transects. Starting in 2017 and until 2022 we have been doing four driving transects every year on BAC. We take advantage of the dirt roads crossing the entire island to cover more or less the entire area. While driving we count all the iguanas we find, and we classify them based on sex and age (juveniles individuals are not assigned a sex because it is almost impossible to distinguish between males and females without an accurate sampling).\nWhile driving around counting iguanas we also record all the dead iguanas that we find along the road. In doing so we can get a rough proportion of the dead-to-alive iguanas. We can then use that number to estimate a per yer percentage of iguanas that get killed by moving machinery only.\n\npath_db &lt;-

Instead of traveling straight from Europe to Ecuador, my colleague and I will reach Ecuador via Lima, Perù. As always, the departure times of each flight is totally unfriendly. The first leg of the journey starts at 07:00 from FCO (Rome), a stop in Madrid.\n\n\n2022-11-01\nAs my memory fails me constantly, I have decided to compile a list of names of people we have met already or that we will be encountering in this trip.

Carlos Caluca was the one who actually found it, but we were all looking for it and eventually it would have come out. Something, likely a giant turtle, walked all over it and basically destroyed it, but it should still be possible to retrieve the information it contains (which I do not expect to be much more than we already have!).\n\n\n2022-12-15\nThe generator gave up on us."

    "text": "This summer, in the midst of the heat wave of late July and early August, we performed a translocation of Cyclura carinata individuals, the Turks and Caicos Rock Iguana, from Little Water Cay to Grouper Cay! Keep reading if you want to know more about this project and how it came about.\n\n\n\nA young Cyclura carinata individual. (Photo credits: G. Colosimo)\n\n\nCyclura carinata is endemic to the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI), a small and beautiful archipelago located north of Hispaniola Island (Haiti and Dominican Republic), in the Caribbean Sea. A species is defined endemic when it is native to a specific region and when it naturally can be found only in that particular area. Turks and Caicos Rock Iguanas is, in fact, native to the TCI and can only be found in this archipelago. The only exception is represented by a small population of TCI Rock Iguanas found on Booby Cay, The Bahamas. Genetic studies have recently demonstrated that the Booby Cay population is the outcome of a past introduction event (Welch et al., 2017). Once occupying almost every single island in the TCI, the distribution range of C carinata dramatically decreased and they are considered extirpated from ca. 95% of their former range (Gerber, 2007).\n\n\n\n\nAn interactive map showing the Turks and Caicos Archipelago and the relative position of source and recipient sites used for the translocation.\n\n\nThe progressive reduction of their range, largely due to the intense development and construction activity on many islands, and the presence of introduced feral mammals (cats, dogs, rats, donkeys, pigs), caused, in 2004, the listing of this species as Critically Endangered (CR) in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red-List of Threatened Species (Gerber, 2004). This means that there is a concrete risk of extinction if no management actions are pursued.\nA group of international researchers and volunteers, collaborating with local institutions like the Department of Environment and Coastal Resources (DECR) and the Turks and Caicos National Trust (TCINT), has been working for many years to ensure that this species could persist and thrive in its natural habitat. Thanks to their work, the implementation of different conservation strategies, and the involvement of local communities, the species has recently been down-listed from CR to Endangered (EN) in the IUCN Red-List of Threatened Species (Gerber et al., 2020). Although this represents very good news, it does not mean that conservation efforts can come to a stop. On the contrary, as the species persistence is still challenged by new development and the presence of introduced feral mammals, the level of guard and attention should not dim.\n\n\n\nA young adult with its bead tag. The colored beads allow for an easy and effective way to remotely identifying the individual without the necessity to capture it. Each color corresponds to a number and a combination of different colors provides the individual numeric identifier. In this case only the white bead is present, indicating that this is individual number 1. (Photo credits: G. Colosimo)\n\n\nAmong different conservation strategies, individuals translocation has proven an effective measure for TCI iguanas. A translocation of individuals entails the collection of adults (or young adults) from a source population to be introduced in a recipient area, usually identified within the historical range of a species. If no historical areas are available or known, a new location can also be selected as recipient area, as long as it presents the appropriate characteristics for the species to thrive.\nA first translocation program was conducted in 2002 and 2003 (Gerber et al., 2004; Gerber, 2007). This year, following up on an intensive project to eradicate invasive mammals from some of the islands in the vicinity of Providenciales, another translocation was performed. Between July and August 2023 we moved 74 adults from Little Water Cay to Grouper Cay. The project authorized by the Scientific Research Permit No. 2023-06-30-32 issued by DECR, was funded through a Darwin grant and leaded by senior research scientist Dr. Glenn Gerber (San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance). We received support from many local political institutions as well from local tour operators.\n\n\n\nFlesh, a representative of the Department of Environment and Coastal Resources, with an adult male Cyclura carinata.

(Photo credits: Dodly).\n\n\nOnce captured, individuals are measured and sexed to make sure that an equal ratio of males and females are moved. Every individual is also assigned a unique identifier (Passive Integrated Trasponder-PIT), very much like the transponders that are used for house cats and dogs. These identifiers will ensure that, if recaptured in the future, that individual will be recognized as one of the animals already sampled. This is a more permanent solution to the application of colored beads. As beads are exposed, they can, eventually, fall from the animal following a fight between individual or the mating between males and females or simply because the wire used for attaching them to the nucal crest breaks.\n\n\n\nJoe (left, U.S. National Park Service), Morgan (center, local tour operato) and Nickoy (right, Turks and Caicos National Trust), while preparing a young adult for the application of beads and radio frequency identifier (RFID) transponder. (Photo credits: G. Colosimo)\n\n\nIn future years it will be necessary to monitor the recipient island of Grouper Cay to make sure that the translocated animals have successfully acclimated to the new island. The best way to monitor the success of a translocation is to document the reproduction of the translocated individuals. In the next few years we will monitor for the presence of hatchlings or yearlings. Stay tuned.\n\n\n\nA hatchling hiding in the vegetation. (Photo credits: G. Colosimo)\n\n\nDid you like this post?

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nWorking with microsatellite genotypes data for many years I always wanted to fully understand how to build a test to verify whether the population(s) under analysis is(are) in Hardy-Weinberg (HW) equilibrium (Hardy, 1908) (or, to be more precise, if the population’s genotypes reflects HW proportions). Checking for HW proportions is generally the first step in any kind of population genetic analysis (Waples et al., 2018).\nOne of the most basic approach to perform such a test is to use the \\(\\chi^{2}\\) method (Allendorf et al., 2022). This approach is particularly useful when the number of loci and alleles is too big to perform a Fisher’s Exact Test (Fisher, 1935). The straight up formula of the \\(\\chi^{2}\\) test is relatively simple: \\(\\chi^{2} = \\sum\\frac{(OBSERVED-EXPECTED)^2}{EXPECTED}\\), where OBSERVED and EXPECTED refer to the number of observed and expected genotypes for each locus and allele. The computed \\(\\chi^{2}\\) value is then compared to a set of values obtained under the assumption of no violation of the \\(H_0\\).\n\n\nShow the R code used to produce the graph\nchiTestVal &lt;- \n  seq(0, 10, by = 0.001)\n\nplot(1-pchisq(chiTestVal, df = 1), chiTestVal, type = \"l\",\n     main = expression(chi^2*\"distribution\"),\n     ylab = \"Test Statistic Value\",\n     xlab = \"p-value\", lwd = 2)\nlines(1-pchisq(chiTestVal, df = 2), chiTestVal, type = \"l\",\n      lwd = 2, col = \"blue\")\nlines(1-pchisq(chiTestVal, df = 3), chiTestVal, type = \"l\",\n      lwd = 2, col = \"green\")\nlines(1-pchisq(chiTestVal, df = 4), chiTestVal, type = \"l\",\n      lwd = 2, col = \"brown\")\nlines(1-pchisq(chiTestVal, df = 5), chiTestVal, type = \"l\",\n      lwd = 2, col = \"deeppink\")\nabline(v=0.05, col = \"red\", lty = 2, lwd = 2)\nlegend(\"topright\", \n       legend = c(\"DoF = 1\", \"DoF = 2\", \"DoF = 3\", \"DoF = 4\", \"DoF = 5\"), \n       col = c(\"black\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"brown\", \"deeppink\"), lty = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: \\(\\chi^{2}\\) distribution graph showing the test statistic on the y axis and its associated p-value on the x axis. The test statistic is calculated with different Degrees of Freedom (DoF). The red dashed line marks the widely used threshold of p-value = 0.05 under which we can reject \\(H_0\\). As DoF increases, the test statistic value needed to reject \\(H_0\\) gets higher.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the \\(\\chi^{2}\\) test is applied in many different situations, there are some cases, for example when there are many genotypes with low expected numbers due the presence of many different alleles, where a different approach may serve us better in testing \\(H_0\\): permutation tests (Allendorf et al., 2022).\nThe overall idea behind this approach is to recreate X number of randomized datasets starting from the observed data. For each generated dataset a \\(\\chi^{2}\\) value is then calculated and compared with the value obtained from the original dataset. The proportion of randomized dataset that produce a \\(\\chi^{2}\\) value as large as or lager than the observed data gives us an unbiased estimate of the probability of rejecting \\(H_0\\) (Allendorf et al., 2022).\nIn this post I will show how I build a permutation test procedure to evaluate the probability of rejecting \\(H_0\\) when working with microsatellite genotypes. I will be using a microsatellite dataset available from Dryad (click here to download). The dataset is borrowed from Chan et al. (2020) and consists of 27 microsatellites typed in 237 individuals. The original dataset is available in  genpop  format. This is a widely used format in R applications and in population genetics analyses.\nThe procedure illustrated here works directly with matrices. Therefore in this first part I will cover the step-by-step procedure to transition from  genpop  to  matrix  format.\n\n\nData wrangling\nTo load the data file, encoded in  genpop  format, we will be using one of the most populat package for genetic analyses in R: adegenet (Jombart, 2008). I will assume you have the package already installed locally on your computer. So, the first thing to do is to load the data file using the following code:\n\nlibrary(adegenet)                                    # package to load\nsceloporus_data &lt;- read.genepop(\"path/to/file.gen\",  # specify the path to the genepop file\n                                ncode = 3,           # how many digits are used for alleles\n                                quiet = T)           # print loading progress on screen\n\nThe read.genepop() function from adegenet automatically converts the data in to a  genind  object, the data format used by adegenet. We can take a look at what it is like just by typing the name of data.\n\nsceloporus_data\n\n/// GENIND OBJECT /////////\n\n // 237 individuals; 27 loci; 442 alleles; size: 499.2 Kb\n\n // Basic content\n   @tab:  237 x 442 matrix of allele counts\n   @loc.n.all: number of alleles per locus (range: 3-35)\n   @loc.fac: locus factor for the 442 columns of @tab\n   @all.names: list of allele names for each locus\n   @ploidy: ploidy of each individual  (range: 2-2)\n   @type:  codom\n   @call: read.genepop(file = \"~/Documents/websites/EvolvoErgoSum/data/doi_10.5061_dryad.sxksn0316__v2/microsatellite_genotypes.gen\", \n    ncode = 3, quiet = T)\n\n // Optional content\n   @pop: population of each individual (group size range: 6-76)\n\n\nThis data format is quite useful as it gives a first glance of what is that we are dealing with. Unfortunately this is not the format needed to perform this custom test. In fact this permutation procedure takes as input file a matrix of genotypes. Rather than giving you an example right now I think is best if we proceed and transform the dataset so that you can see how the input file should look like. The first step is to transform the data object in a data frame.\n\nsceloporus_data_df &lt;- genind2df(sceloporus_data)\nsceloporus_data_df[1:10, 1:9]\n\n              pop sa5220 sa5229 sa6002 sa6012  sar80  sar84 sarms0001 sarms0344\nDJL286  TCWC93505 109112 233233 121129 146146 362398 117123    207207    251251\nDJL297  TCWC93505 109109 201225 121129 134140 350358 117117    199199    242242\nDL924   TCWC93505 109112 185185 121129 146152   &lt;NA&gt; 117117    207207    242245\nDL925   TCWC93505 109112 221241 121121 142144 374382 117117    207199    251251\nESP9057 TCWC93505 109109 225221 121121 136136 378378 117117    207207    242242\nESP9070 TCWC93505 109112 205229 121121 140144 374374 117117    207199    251242\nESP9479 TCWC93505 109109 229237 121121 146144 350354 117135    207207    251251\nESP9480 TCWC93505 109109 201229 121121 134128 354353 117135    207207    251242\nESP9485 TCWC93505 109112 233225 121121 128138 350353 117135    207207    251251\nESP9486 TCWC93505 109112 225245 129117 140140 350382 117131    207207    242242\n\n\nBy inspecting the first 10 individuals and 9 loci we notice that the function has nicely organized our individuals in rows, kept the population information in the first column, and used the other columns for the genotypes.
