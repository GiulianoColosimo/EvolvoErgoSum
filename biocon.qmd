## General

This is a course for master level students enrolled in the "Biologia Evoluzionistica, Ecologia e Antropologia Applicata" degree at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. It is worth **6 CFU** for a total of 48 hours to be administered in person (or remotely, depending on the evolution of the pandemic) during the second semester of each academic year. Students participating to this class should have a good knowledge of zoology, ecology, population biology,  genetics, and molecular biology.

## Topics

Here is a brief overview of the topics covered in class. These are not set in stone and may vary throughout the course. Also, they are not always covered in the same order they are presented here.
