I was born in 1985 and raised in Rome (IT). Always enthusiastic about the outdoors and all critters populating it. I got by primary and secondary education in Rome, but when I got to college I knew I wanted to know how people were conducting research outside of Italy and Europe. During my master I spent six months at Aarhus University (Denmark) thanks to the ERASMUS project. After I graduated with a Master in Ecology and Evolution from the University of Rome Tor Vergata I decided to get a PhD, and started looking for a program that could interest me. I found one at Mississippi State University (Mississippi, USA), and Starkville became home for about 6 years.

I got my PhD degree in December 2016. My project focused on understanding the population dynamics of iguanas inhabiting highly fragmented habitats in the Caribbean region. I focused on two species, the Turks and Caicos Rock Iguana, *Cyclura carinata*, and the Bahamas Rock Iguanas, *Cyclura cychlura*.

After my Ph.D. I stayed in contact with a scientist from the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Association (SDZWA) who had been a member of my committee. He was interested in writing a project on the pink iguanas of Galápagos, and I was too. We teamed up to collaborate with a colleague from the University of Rome Tor Vergata. That project was funded by SDZWA and granted me the possibility to do a PostDoc for 5 years and to keep doing my research in the Caribbean as well as in the Galápagos.
