This model was developed together with 2 PhD students Marco Gargano and Lorenzo Garizio, and with the help of Drs. Paolo Gratton e Silvio Marta.

We used mark recapture data collected over 20 years to estimate the population size of Conolophus marthae, the critically endangered Gal√°pagos pink land iguana.
