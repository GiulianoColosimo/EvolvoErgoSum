# 

Not sure I mentioned that I like to travel a lot. This is an interactive map showing the places I have visited.


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = T}
library(spData)
library(tmap)
m <- tm_shape(world) +
  tm_fill()
tmap_mode("view")
m

#data.frame(city = c("Roma", "Aarhus", "Starkville"),
#           lat = c(),
#           lon = c(),
#           notes = c("Home town", "My ERASMUS experience", "PhD"))
```
