The latest paper titled *Trafficking of Galápagos iguanas as an example of a global problem: CITES permits, laundering and the role of transit countries in Europe and Africa* is finally out. Huge effort, involving 20 colleagues and authors and experts on the matter.

The paper's highlights:

- We highlight the smuggling of Galápagos iguanas in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Pacific region.
- Wild caught Galapagos iguanas are laundered into international trade declared as captive-bred. The offspring of such animals receive CITES permits in violation of CITES regulations.
- Since 1975 all four iguana species have been listed on Appendix II of CITES.
- We notice inaccuracies documented in the CITES trade database.
- We urge CITES Parties to transfer all four species of Galápagos iguanas from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I.
