## Welcome!

This is where I keep track of my projects, publications, research work, and ideas. While helping me to keep my thoughts organized, this space is also an opportunity to share them with the rest of the world. Not that the world needs my thoughts, but I most definitely could benefit from the world's feedback. At any rate, welcome! Hope you will find something interesting, eventually.

### A brief introduction.

I’m a research associate working at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. One of the main aspects of my current research can be resumed with the acronym **T. A. Co.** — **T**racking **A**nimal and **Co**nservation. The project aims at developing an integrated, versatile, miniaturized and cost-effective system for the remote monitoring of endangered animal species from even disconnected and difficult to access areas. Keep digging around to know more about this project. As a faculty at Tor Vergata University, I am also responsible for teaching classes and mentoring/tutoring students.
