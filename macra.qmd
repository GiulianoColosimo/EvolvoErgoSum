This is a pilot project to use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms, routinely employed in the analysis of large datasets in particle collisions at CERN, to automatically recognize cardiac and respiratory rates from wild and domestic animal species starting from data collected via inertial measurement units (accelerometer and gyroscope). The aim of this pilot project is to validate this approach and demonstrate the applicability of such a technique for monitoring these parameters in wild animals in their natural habitats.
